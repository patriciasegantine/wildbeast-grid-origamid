          The wolf (Canis lupus[a]), also known as the gray wolf or grey wolf,
          is a large canine native to Eurasia and North America. More than
          thirty subspecies of Canis lupus have been recognized.
        </p>

        <img class="image-1" src="img/wolf1.jpg" alt="Wolf" />

        <p class="destaque">
          The wolf is nonetheless related closely enough to smaller Canis
          species, such as the coyote and the golden jackal, to produce fertile
          hybrids with them.
        </p>

        <img class="image-2" src="img/wolf2.jpg" alt="" />

        <p>
          The wolf is the largest extant member of the family Canidae, males
          averaging 40 kg (88 lb) and females 37 kg (82 lb). Wolves measure
          105–160 cm (41–63 in) in length and 80–85 cm (31–33 in) at shoulder
          height. The wolf is also distinguished from other Canis species by its
          less pointed ears and muzzle, as well as a shorter torso and a longer
          tail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of all members of the genus Canis, the wolf is most specialized for
          cooperative game hunting as demonstrated by its physical adaptations
          to tackling large prey, its more social nature, and its highly
          advanced expressive behaviour. It travels in nuclear families
          consisting of a mated pair accompanied by their offspring.

            black, although subspecies in the arctic region may be nearly all

            It travels in nuclear families consisting of a mated pair accompanie
            by their offspring. Offspring may leave to form their own packs on
            the onset of sexual maturity and in response to competition for food
            within the pack.
